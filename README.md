# CIS460 Final Project - Mini Minecraft #


### Attention

* `master` branch is used for the stable version. **Please do not directly `git push` to the `master` branch.** Use `git config --global push.default matching` to configure your `git push` command to push to the corresponding branch.

* There're 3 other branches, corresponding to the three parts of the week1 milestone. Please use `git clone -b <your-branch-name> <remote-repo>` to clone your branch to your machine.

* **Please do not use `git clone <remote-repo>` directly.** It clones the `master` branch by default. If you clone in this way, use `git checkout <your-branch-name>` to switch your branch from `master` to `<your-branch-name>`.

* I strongly suggest each one adds a prefix before the name of the new class. For example, if I create a class named `Shpere`, I should modify its name to `KxShpere` or `PcdTerrainSphere` (`Pcd` is the abbreviation of "procedural"). In a word, this is a group project. Please write your code beautifully and it plays a key role in debugging.
