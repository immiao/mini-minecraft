### Attention

* `master` branch is used for the stable version. **Please do not directly `git push` to the `master` branch.** Use `git config --global push.default matching` to set your `git push` command to push to the corresponding branch.

* There're 3 other branches, corresponding to the three parts of the week1 milestone. Please use `git clone -b <your-branch-name> <remote-repo>` to clone your branch to your machine.

* **Please do not use `git clone <remote-repo>` directly.** It clones the `master` branch by default.
