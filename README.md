# CIS460 Final Project - Mini Minecraft #


### Attention

* `master` branch is used for the stable version. **Please do not directly `git push` to the `master` branch.**

* There're 3 other branches, corresponding to the three parts of the week1 milestone. Please use `git clone -b <your-branch-name> <remote-repo>` to clone your branch to your machine.

* `git clone <remote-repo>` works as well, but it will clone all the branches. If you clone in this way, keep in mind not to corrupt the `master` branch (the stable version). Use `git config --global push.default matching` to set your `git push` command to push to the corresponding branch. Use `git branch -v` to see your current branch. Use `git checkout <branch-name>` to switch your current branch.
